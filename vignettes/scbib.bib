@article{lee_comparison_2011,
	Abstract = {Disease mapping is the area of epidemiology that estimates the spatial pattern in disease risk over an extended geographical region, so that areas with elevated risk levels can be identified. Bayesian hierarchical models are typically used in this context, which represent the risk surface using a combination of available covariate data and a set of spatial random effects. These random effects are included to model any overdispersion or spatial correlation in the disease data, that has not been accounted for by the available covariate information. The random effects are typically modelled by a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution, and a number of alternative specifications have been proposed. This paper critiques four of the most common models within the CAR class, and assesses their appropriateness via a simulation study. The four models are then applied to a new study mapping cancer incidence in Greater Glasgow, Scotland, between 2001 and 2005.},

@article{long_bayesian_2012,
	Abstract = {In this article we present a Bayesian Markov model for investigating environmental spread processes. We formulate a model where the spread of a disease over a heterogeneous landscape through time is represented as a probabilistic function of two processes: local diffusion and random-jump dispersal. This formulation represents two mechanisms of spread which result in highly peaked and long-tailed distributions of dispersal distances (i.e., local and long-distance spread), commonly observed in the spread of infectious diseases and biological invasions. We demonstrate the properties of this model using a simulation experiment and an empirical case study -- the spread of mountain pine beetle in western Canada. Posterior predictive checking was used to validate the number of newly inhabited regions in each time period. The model performed well in the simulation study in which a goodness-of-fit statistic measuring the number of newly inhabited regions in each time interval fell within the 95\% posterior predictive credible interval in over 97\% of simulations. The case study of a mountain pine beetle infestation in western Canada (1999--2009) extended the base model in two ways. First, spatial covariates thought to impact the local diffusion parameters, elevation and forest cover, were included in the model. Second, a refined definition for translocation or jump-dispersal based on mountain pine beetle ecology was incorporated improving the fit of the model. Posterior predictive checks on the mountain pine beetle model found that the observed goodness-of-fit test statistic fell within the 95\% posterior predictive credible interval for 8 out of 10 years. The simulation study and case study provide evidence that the model presented here is both robust and flexible; and is therefore appropriate for a wide range of spread processes in epidemiology and ecology.},

@article{bennett_characterising_2013,
	Abstract = {In order to use environmental models effectively for management and decision-making, it is vital to establish an appropriate level of confidence in their performance. This paper reviews techniques available across various fields for characterising the performance of environmental models with focus on numerical, graphical and qualitative methods. General classes of direct value comparison, coupling real and modelled values, preserving data patterns, indirect metrics based on parameter values, and data transformations are discussed. In practice environmental modelling requires the use and implementation of workflows that combine several methods, tailored to the model purpose and dependent upon the data and information available. A five-step procedure for performance evaluation of models is suggested, with the key elements including: (i) (re)assessment of the model's aim, scale and scope; (ii) characterisation of the data for calibration and testing; (iii) visual and other analysis to detect under- or non-modelled behaviour and to gain an overview of overall performance; (iv) selection of basic performance criteria; and (v) consideration of more advanced methods to handle problems such as systematic divergence between modelled and observed values.},

	Abstract = {A methodology for landslide susceptibility mapping using an integrated remote sensing and GIS approach is presented. A part of the Darjeeling Himalaya was selected for the model execution. IRS satellite data, topographic maps, field data, and other informative maps were used as inputs to the study. Important terrain factors, contributing to landslide occurrences in the region, were identified and corresponding thematic data layers were generated. These data layers represent the geological, topographical, and hydrological conditions of the terrain. A numerical rating scheme for the factors was developed for spatial data analysis in a GIS. The resulting landslide susceptibility map delineates the area into different zones of four relative susceptibility classes: high, moderate, low, and very low. The susceptibility map was validated by correlating the landslide frequencies of different classes. This has shown a close agreement with the existing field instability condition. The effectiveness of the map was also confirmed by the high statistically significant value of a chi-square test.},

A central element of these calls involves the development of a spatial intuition or a statistical intuition, i.e., conceptual ways of framing questions, incorporating available data, calculating quantitative summaries, interpreting outcomes, and providing empirical answers from either a spatial or a statistical perspective. In this paper, I draw on past experience to identify and illustrate the potential for ``spatial statistical thinking'', that is, the development of a spatial statistical intuition. Several examples illustrate the potential for a more explicit development of such intuition drawing simultaneously from both spatial analysis and statistics. As a step in this direction, I stress the importance of maintaining a spatial conceptual framework in the application and interpretation of spatial statistical methods, i.e., the importance of spatial interpretation of spatial statistics.},

@article{wheeler_assessment_2007,
	Abstract = {The realization in the statistical and geographical sciences that a relationship between an explanatory variable and a response variable in a linear regression model is not always constant across a study area has led to the development of regression models that allow for spatially varying coefficients. Two competing models of this type are geographically weighted regression (GWR) and Bayesian regression models with spatially varying coefficient processes (SVCP). In the application of these spatially varying coefficient models, marginal inference on the regression coefficient spatial processes is typically of primary interest. In light of this fact, there is a need to assess the validity of such marginal inferences, since these inferences may be misleading in the presence of explanatory variable collinearity. In this paper, we present the results of a simulation study designed to evaluate the sensitivity of the spatially varying coefficients in the competing models to various levels of collinearity. The simulation study results show that the Bayesian regression model produces more accurate inferences on the regression coefficients than does GWR. In addition, the Bayesian regression model is overall fairly robust in terms of marginal coefficient inference to moderate levels of collinearity, and degrades less substantially than GWR with strong collinearity.},

@article{jasiewicz_landscape_2014,
	Abstract = {We introduce landscape similarity --- a numerical measure that assesses affinity between two landscapes on the basis of similarity between the patterns of their constituent landform elements. Such a similarity function provides core technology for a landscape search engine --- an algorithm that parses the topography of a study area and finds all places with landscapes broadly similar to a landscape template. A landscape search can yield answers to a query in real time, enabling a highly effective means to explore large topographic datasets. In turn, a landscape search facilitates auto-mapping of physiographic units within a study area. The country of Poland serves as a test bed for these novel concepts. The topography of Poland is given by a 30 m resolution DEM. The geomorphons method is applied to this DEM to classify the topography into ten common types of landform elements. A local landscape is represented by a square tile cut out of a map of landform elements. A histogram of cell-pair features is used to succinctly encode the composition and texture of a pattern within a local landscape. The affinity between two local landscapes is assessed using the Wave-Hedges similarity function applied to the two corresponding histograms. For a landscape search the study area is organized into a lattice of local landscapes. During the search the algorithm calculates the similarity between each local landscape and a given query. Our landscape search for Poland is implemented as a GeoWeb application called TerraEx-Pl and is available at http://sil.uc.edu/. Given a sample, or a number of samples, from a target physiographic unit the landscape search delineates this unit using the principles of supervised machine learning. Repeating this procedure for all units yields a complete physiographic map. The application of this methodology to topographic data of Poland results in the delineation of nine physiographic units. The resultant map bears a close resemblance to a conventional physiographic map of Poland; differences can be attributed to geological and paleogeographical input used in drawing the conventional map but not utilized by the mapping algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Clifford, Richardson, and Hemon (1989, Biometrics 45, 123-134) presented modified tests of association between two spatially autocorrelated processes, for lattice and non-lattice data. These tests are built on the sample covariance and on the sample correlation coefficient; they require the estimation of an effective sample size that takes into account the spatial structure of both processes. Clifford et al. developed their method on the basis of an approximation of the variance of the sample correlation coefficient and assessed it by Monte Carlo simulations for lattice and non-lattice networks of moderate to large size. In the present paper, the variance of the sample covariance is computed for a finite number of locations, under the multinormality assumption, and the mathematical derivation of the definition of effective sample size is given. The theoretically expected number of degrees of freedom for the modified t test with renewed modifications is compared with that computed on the basis of equation (2.9) of Clifford et al. (1989). The largest differences are observed for small numbers of locations and high autocorrelation, in particular when the latter is present with opposite sign in the two processes. Basic references that were missing in Clifford et al. (1989) are given and inherent ambiguities are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Abstract. 
Texture features are widely used in image retrieval literature. However, conventional texture features are extracted from grayscale images without taking color information into consideration. We present two improved texture descriptors, named color Gabor wavelet texture (CGWT) and color Gabor opponent texture (CGOT), respectively, for the purpose of remote sensing image retrieval. The former consists of unichrome features computed from color channels independently and opponent features computed across different color channels at different scales, while the latter consists of Gabor texture features and opponent features mentioned above. The two representations incorporate discriminative information among color bands, thus describing well the remote sensing images that have multiple objects. Experimental results demonstrate that CGWT yields better performance compared to other state-of-the-art texture features, and CGOT not only improves the retrieval results of some image classes that have unsatisfactory performance using CGWT representation, but also increases the average precision of all queried images further. In addition, a similarity measure function for proposed representation CGOT has been defined to give a convincing evaluation.},

@article{wulder_multi-temporal_2008,
	Abstract = {Mountain pine beetle red attack damage has been successfully detected and mapped using single-date high spatial resolution (\&lt; 4 m) satellite multi-spectral data. Forest managers; however, need to monitor locations for changes in beetle populations over time. Specifically, counts of individual trees attacked in successive years provide an indication of beetle population growth and dynamics. Surveys are typically used to estimate the ratio of green (current) attack trees to red (previous) attack trees or G:R. In this study, we estimate average stand-level G:R using a time-series of QuickBird multi-spectral and panchromatic satellite data, combined with field data for three forested stands near Merritt, British Columbia, Canada. Using a ratio of QuickBird red to green wavelengths (Red--Green Index or RGI), the change in RGI (ΔRGI) in successive image pairs is used to estimate red attack damage in 2004, 2005, and 2006, with true positive accuracies ranging from 89 to 93\%. To overcome issues associated with differing viewing geometry and illumination angles that impair tracking of individual trees through time, segments are generated from the QuickBird multi-spectral data to identify small groups of trees. These segments then serve as the vehicle for monitoring changes in red attack damage over time. A local maxima filter is applied to the panchromatic data to estimate stem counts, thereby allowing an indication of the total stand population at risk of attack. By combining the red attack damage estimates with the local maxima stem counts, predictions are made of the number of attacked trees in a given year. Backcasting the current year's red attack damaged trees as the previous year's green attack facilitates the estimation of an average stand G:R. In this study area, these retrospective G:R values closely match those generated from field surveys. The results of this study indicate that a monitoring program using a time series of high spatial resolution remotely sensed data (multi-spectral and panchromatic) over select sample locations, could be used to estimate G:R over large areas, facilitating landscape level management strategies and/or providing a mechanism for assessing the efficacy of previously implemented strategies.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the properties of a metric between two distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), for content-based image retrieval. The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.},

	Abstract = {The family of Kappa indices of agreement claim to compare a map's observed classification accuracy relative to the expected accuracy of baseline maps that can have two types of randomness: (1) random distribution of the quantity of each category and (2) random spatial allocation of the categories. Use of the Kappa indices has become part of the culture in remote sensing and other fields. This article examines five different Kappa indices, some of which were derived by the first author in 2000. We expose the indices' properties mathematically and illustrate their limitations graphically, with emphasis on Kappa's use of randomness as a baseline, and the often-ignored conversion from an observed sample matrix to the estimated population matrix. This article concludes that these Kappa indices are useless, misleading and/or flawed for the practical applications in remote sensing that we have seen. After more than a decade of working with these indices, we recommend that the profession abandon the use of Kappa indices for purposes of accuracy assessment and map comparison, and instead summarize the cross-tabulation matrix with two much simpler summary parameters: quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement. This article shows how to compute these two parameters using examples taken from peer-reviewed literature.},

We used FRAGSTATS and principal components analysis (PCA) to identify independent components of landscape structure, and cluster analysis to group the components. We then calculated the universality, strength, and consistency of the identified landscape structure components. At the class-level we identified 24 independent configuration components. Seven of these components were nearly universal and consistent in interpreted meaning. At the landscape-level there were 17 independent structure components. Eight of these components were universal and consistent. These results indicate that there are consistent combinations of metrics that universally describe the major attributes of landscape structure at the class- and landscape-levels.},

A new method of change detection is proposed for identifying forest land cover change using high spatial resolution satellite images. Combining the advantages of image segmentation, image differencing and stochastic analysis of the multispectral signal, this OB-Reflectance method is object-based and statistically driven. From a multidate image, a single segmentation using region-merging technique delineates multidate objects characterised by their reflectance differences statistics. Objects considered as outliers from multitemporal point of view are successfully discriminated thanks to a statistical procedure, i.e., the iterative trimming. Based on a chi-square test of hypothesis, abnormal values of reflectance differences statistics are identified and the corresponding objects are labelled as change. The object-based method performances were assessed using two sources of reference data, including one independent forest inventory, and were compared to a pixel-based method using the RGB-NDVI technique. High detection accuracy (\&gt; 90\%) and overall Kappa (\&gt; 0.80) were achieved by OB-Reflectance method in temperate forests using three SPOT-HRV images covering a 10-year period.},

@article{churchill_restoring_2013,
	Abstract = {Stand-level spatial pattern influences key aspects of resilience and ecosystem function such as disturbance behavior, regeneration, snow retention, and habitat quality in frequent-fire pine and mixed-conifer forests. Reference sites, from both pre-settlement era reconstructions and contemporary forests with active fire regimes, indicate that frequent-fire forests are complex mosaics of individual trees, tree clumps, and openings. There is a broad scientific consensus that restoration treatments should seek to restore this mosaic pattern in order to restore resilience and maintain ecosystem function. Yet, methods to explicitly incorporate spatial reference information into restoration treatments are not widely used. In addition, targets from reference conditions must be critically evaluated in light of climate change. We used a spatial clump identification algorithm to quantify reference patterns based on a specified inter-tree distance that defines when trees form clumps. We used climatic water balance parameters, downscaled climate projections, and plant associations to assess our historical reference sites in the context of projected future climate and identify climate analog reference conditions. Spatial reference information was incorporated into a novel approach to prescription development, tree marking, and monitoring based on viewing stand structure and pattern in terms of individuals, clumps, and openings (ICO) in a mixed-conifer forest restoration case study. We compared the results from the ICO approach with simulations of traditional basal area and spacing-based thinning prescriptions in terms of agreement with reference conditions and functional aspects of resilience. The ICO method resulted in a distribution of tree clumps and openings within the range of reference patterns, while the basal area and spacing approaches resulted in uniform patterns inconsistent with known reference conditions. Susceptibility to insect mortality was lower in basal area and spacing prescriptions, but openings and corresponding opportunities for regeneration and in situ climate adaptation were fewer. Operationally, the method struck a balance between providing clear targets for spatial pattern directly linked to reference conditions, sufficient flexibility to achieve other restoration objectives, and implementation efficiency. The need to track pattern targets during implementation and provide immediate feedback to marking crews was a key lesson. The ICO method, especially when used in combination with climate analog reference targets, offers a practical approach to restoring spatial patterns that are likely to enhance resilience and climate adaptation.},

	Abstract = {This article concerns the identification of the expertise that GI scientists have in common. Rather than attempt to be exhaustive, the approach is to identify a minimal set of expert topics shared across GI science. In this article, a set of five expert topics is proposed for this purpose: structure, uncertainty, dynamism, language and cognition, and design with geographic information. The article then examines the extent to which the literature lends support for these five topics, using two analyses: first, a qualitative analysis of the papers found in the 2006 Classics from IJGIS; and second a citation analysis investigating the occurrences of keywords related to the proposed expert topics. The results suggest that these five areas of expertise do indeed tend to distinguish research in GI science from that in other fields, and in particular where the expert topics occur in combination. The establishment of an acknowledged core of shared expertise should assist in interdisciplinary research and teaching collaboration, usually founded on a shared understanding of what expertise different partners can contribute.},

Big data can be situated in the disciplinary area of traditional geospatial data handling theory and methods. The increasing volume and varying format of collected geospatial big data presents challenges in storing, managing, processing, analyzing, visualizing and verifying the quality of data. This has implications for the quality of decisions made with big data. Consequently, this position paper of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Technical Commission II (TC II) revisits the existing geospatial data handling methods and theories to determine if they are still capable of handling emerging geospatial big data. Further, the paper synthesises problems, major issues and challenges with current developments as well as recommending what needs to be developed further in the near future.},

	Abstract = {A methodological framework for spatial prediction based on regression-kriging is described and compared with ordinary kriging and plain regression. The data are first transformed using logit transformation for target variables and factor analysis for continuous predictors (auxiliary maps). The target variables are then fitted using step-wise regression and residuals interpolated using kriging. A generic visualisation method is used to simultaneously display predictions and associated uncertainty. The framework was tested using 135 profile observations from the national survey in Croatia, divided into interpolation (100) and validation sets (35). Three target variables: organic matter, pH in topsoil and topsoil thickness were predicted from six relief parameters and nine soil mapping units. Prediction efficiency was evaluated using the mean error and root mean square error (RMSE) of prediction at validation points. The results show that the proposed framework improves efficiency of predictions. Moreover, it ensured normality of residuals and enforced prediction values to be within the physical range of a variable. For organic matter, it achieved lower relative RMSE than ordinary kriging (53.3\% versus 66.5\%). For topsoil thickness, it achieved a lower relative RMSE (66.5\% versus 83.3\%) and a lower bias than ordinary kriging (0.15 versus 0.69 cm). The prediction of pH in topsoil was difficult with all three methods. This framework can adopt both continuous and categorical soil variables in a semi-automated or automated manner. It opens a possibility to develop a bundle algorithm that can be implemented in a GIS to interpolate soil profile data from existing datasets.},

@article{wulder_map_2004,
	Abstract = {Any given geographic area is often subjected to numerous mapping efforts over the course of time. Similar end products may be generated from the same data source with similar target attributes. For instance, two maps representing the land cover of Canada were produced in 1995 and 1997 with data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite: the Northern Biosphere Observation and Modeling Experiment (NBIOME) product produced by Natural Resources Canada, and the International Geosphere--Biosphere Programme Data and Information System (IGBP DISCover) product. The thematic and spatial agreement of the forested classes of the map area representing Canada are considered in this study. A difference image was generated for each of two scenarios, where one product identified forest and the other identified non-forest and vice versa. Standard area summaries and per-pixel analyses were used to initially identify and quantify the differences between the two map products. To enable a more comprehensive comparison of the two map products, a 50 km × 50 km grid extending over the entire area of Canada was used as a framework for analyzing the spatial autocorrelation in the difference images. Differences that are not spatially autocorrelated are considered random; conversely, differences that are spatially autocorrelated may be systematic and reflect differences in classification legends and methodologies, and in image-processing methods. The total estimates of forest area from both maps are similar, varying by 6\%, yet the area of agreement between the two maps (i.e., where both mapping processes have the same result in the same location) represents 62\% of the total area classified as forest in both maps, or 35\% of Canada. The spatial distribution of these classification differences is captured through the introduction of ancillary data (ecozones) and the consideration of spatial autocorrelation. Predominantly, spatially autocorrelated differences are found to occur within ecozones that are transition areas between forest and non-forest and at ecozonal interfaces. These differences appear related to the heterogeneous nature of the land cover and the small size of contiguous forest stands. In this research we demonstrate a range of approaches to map comparison. These approaches enable end users of map products to make informed decisions regarding various large area land cover products and to understand the implications of using these different products as inputs for subsequent applications or models.},

Gene frequency surfaces generated by a simulation of Wright's isolation-by-distance model were shown to exhibit spatial autocorrelation, except in the panmictic case. Identical stochastic generating processes result in surfaces with characteristics that are functions of the process parameters, such as parental vagility and neighborhood size. Differences in these parameters are detectable as differences in spatial autocorrelations after only a few generations of the simulations. Separate realizations of processes with identical parameters yield similar spatial correlograms. We have examined the inferences about population structure that could have been made from these observations if they had been real, rather than simulated, populations. From such inferences, we could have drawn conclusions about the presence of selection, migration and drift in given natural systems.},

Examples of such data in ecology include x-y coordinates of organisms in mapped field plots. I illustrate the methods with analyses of data from mapped field plots on Mount St. Helens, Washington state, USA. The statistical methods I emphasize are graphical methods that rely on analysis of distances between organisms. Hypothesis testing for methods like these is easily done using Monte Carlo methods, which I also discuss. For both univariate and bivariate analyses, I find that second-order methods such as K-function plots are often preferable to first-order methods (i.e., QQ-plots). However, for multivariate analyses, these second-order methods are more sensitive to small sample sizes than first-order analyses.},

@article{jacquez_map_1995,
	Abstract = {The quality of environmental studies is often compromised by the use of statistics, such as correlation and regression for example, which presuppose a statistical model, linear or otherwise, between two variables. When investigating hypotheses about relationships among geographically distributed variables, an alternative approach is to measure the amount of boundary overlap. Boundaries are geographic zones of rapid change in the intensity of a variable, and are often of scientific interest in their own right. Examples of boundaries include ecotones, genetic hybrid zones, pollution plumes, and the front of the wave of advance of an epidemic. Boundary overlap describes zones where boundaries from two or more variables coincide, and are useful for evaluating epidemiologic hypotheses relating health to environmental exposures. This paper proposes four statistics of boundary overlap, and explores their performance using simulation models and real data describing ozone concentrations and hospital admissions for respiratory conditions. The statistics are found sensitive to different aspects of boundary overlap, and provide an additional diagnostic tool in the analysis of geographically distributed variables. Overlap statistics are expected to come into increasing use as the installed base of geographic information systems increases.},

@article{burguet_statistical_2014,
	Abstract = {In biological systems, functions and spatial organizations are closely related. Spatial data in biology frequently consist of, or can be assimilated to, sets of points. An important goal in the quantitative analysis of such data is the evaluation and localization of differences in spatial distributions between groups. Because of experimental replications, achieving this goal requires comparing collections of point sets, a noticeably challenging issue for which no method has been proposed to date. We introduce a strategy to address this problem, based on the comparison of point intensities throughout space. Our method is based on a statistical test that determines whether local point intensities, estimated using replicated data, are significantly different or not. Repeating this test at different positions provides an intensity comparison map and reveals domains showing significant intensity differences. Simulated data were used to characterize and validate this approach. The method was then applied to two different neuroanatomical systems to evaluate its ability to reveal spatial differences in biological data sets. Applied to two distinct neuronal populations within the rat spinal cord, the method generated an objective representation of the spatial segregation established previously on a subjective visual basis. The method was also applied to analyze the spatial distribution of locus coeruleus neurons in control and mutant mice. The results objectively consolidated previous conclusions obtained from visual comparisons. Remarkably, they also provided new insights into the maturation of the locus coeruleus in mutant and control animals. Overall, the method introduced here is a new contribution to the quantitative analysis of biological organizations that provides meaningful spatial representations which are easy to understand and to interpret. Finally, because our approach is generic and punctual structures are widespread at the cellular and histological scales, it is potentially useful for a large spectrum of applications for the analysis of biological systems.},

	Abstract = {The statistical methodology for the analysis of replicated spatial point patterns in complex designs such as those including replications is fairly undeveloped. A mixed model is developed in conjunction with maximum pseudolikelihood and generalized linear mixed modeling by extending Baddeley and Turner's (2000, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics 42, 283--322) work on pseudolikelihood for single patterns. A simulation experiment is performed on parameter estimation. Fixed‐ and mixed‐effect models are compared, and in some respects the mixed model is found to be superior. An example using the Strauss process for modeling neuron locations in post‐mortem brain slices is shown.},

@article{diggle_analysis_1991,
	Abstract = {Our application concerns the analysis of the spatial distributions of pyramidal neurons in the cingulate cortex of human subjects in three diagnostic groupings. Our purpose is to develop and apply several methods for the analysis of replicated spatial point patterns to identify anatomical differences between normal, schizoaffective, and schizophrenic persons at the time of death. We begin with a scaled Poisson analysis that uncovers significant differences between the groups in the mean numbers of neurons in the sampled region, as well as a high degree of extra-Poisson variation in the distribution of cell counts within these groups. We then proceed to calculate two different functional descriptors of pattern for each subject to investigate departures from completely random patterns, both between subjects and between groups, while adjusting for cell count differences. The distributions of our main functional pattern descriptor and of our derived test statistic are unknown. For nonparametric inference, we propose a bootstrap procedure in which we resample our data to estimate the null distribution of our test statistic, even though the null hypothesis is not supported by these data. A simulation study provides evidence of the validity and power of our procedure for bootstrap hypothesis testing in our context. We conclude with a summary of what has been learned through this study about the cellular structure of cingulate cortex in persons with psychotic disorders and with some suggested directions for future research.},

@article{yang_geographic_2013,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates local invariant features for geographic (overhead) image retrieval. Local features are particularly well suited for the newer generations of aerial and satellite imagery whose increased spatial resolution, often just tens of centimeters per pixel, allows a greater range of objects and spatial patterns to be recognized than ever before. Local invariant features have been successfully applied to a broad range of computer vision problems and, as such, are receiving increased attention from the remote sensing community particularly for challenging tasks such as detection and classification. We perform an extensive evaluation of local invariant features for image retrieval of land-use/land-cover (LULC) classes in high-resolution aerial imagery. We report on the effects of a number of design parameters on a bag-of-visual-words (BOVW) representation including saliency- versus grid-based local feature extraction, the size of the visual codebook, the clustering algorithm used to create the codebook, and the dissimilarity measure used to compare the BOVW representations. We also perform comparisons with standard features such as color and texture. The performance is quantitatively evaluated using a first-of-its-kind LULC ground truth data set which will be made publicly available to other researchers. In addition to reporting on the effects of the core design parameters, we also describe interesting findings such as the performance-efficiency tradeoffs that are possible through the appropriate pairings of different-sized codebooks and dissimilarity measures. While the focus is on image retrieval, we expect our insights to be informative for other applications such as detection and classification.},

@article{long_characterizing_2010,
	Abstract = {Forest fragmentation can generally be considered as two components: 1) compositional change representing forest loss, and 2) configurational change or change in the arrangement of forest land cover. Forest loss and configurational change occur simultaneously, resulting in difficulties isolating the impacts of each component. Measures of forest fragmentation typically consider forest loss and configurational change together. The ecological responses to forest loss and configurational change are different, thus motivating the creation of measures capable of isolating these separate components. In this research, we develop and demonstrate a measure, the proportion of landscape displacement from configuration (Py), to quantify the relative contributions of forest loss and configurational change to forest fragmentation. Landscapes with statistically significant forest loss or configurational change are identified using neutral landscape simulations to generate underlying distributions for Py. The new measure, Py, is applied to a forest landscape where substantial forest loss has occurred from mountain pine beetle mitigation and salvage harvesting. The percent of forest cover and six LPIs (edge density, number of forest patches, area of largest forest patch, mean perimeter area ratio, corrected mean perimeter area ratio, and aggregation index) are used to quantify forest fragmentation and change. In our study area, significant forest loss occurs more frequently than significant configurational change. The Py method we demonstrate is effective at identifying landscapes undergoing significant forest loss, significant configurational change, or experiencing a combination of both loss and configurational change.},

@article{long_mapping_2015,
	Abstract = {BackgroundThe study of inter-individual interactions (often termed spatial-temporal interactions, or dynamic interactions) from remote tracking data has focused primarily on identifying the presence of such interactions. New datasets and methods offer opportunity to answer more nuanced questions, such as where on the landscape interactions occur. In this paper, we provide a new approach for mapping areas of spatial-temporal overlap in wildlife from remote tracking data. The method, termed the joint potential path area (jPPA) builds from the time-geographic movement model, originally proposed for studying human movement patterns.ResultsThe jPPA approach can be used to delineate sub-areas of the home range where inter-individual interaction was possible. Maps of jPPA regions can be integrated with existing geographic data to explore landscape conditions and habitat associated with spatial temporal-interactions in wildlife. We apply the jPPA approach to simulated biased correlated random walks to demonstrate the method under known conditions. The jPPA method is then applied to three dyads, consisting of fine resolution (15 minute sampling interval) GPS tracking data of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) collected in Oklahoma, USA. Our results demonstrate the ability of the jPPA to identify and map jPPA sub-areas of the home range. We show how jPPA maps can be used to identify habitat differences (using percent tree canopy cover as a habitat indicator) between areas of spatial-temporal overlap and the overall home range in each of the three deer dyads.ConclusionsThe value of the jPPA approach within current wildlife habitat analysis workflows is highlighted along with its simple and straightforward implementation and interpretation. Given the current emphasis on remote tracking in wildlife movement and habitat research, new approaches capable of leveraging both the spatial and temporal information content contained within these data are warranted. We make code (in the statistical software R) for implementing the jPPA approach openly available for other researchers.},

@article{urban_graph_2009,
	Abstract = {Graph theory is a body of mathematics dealing with problems of connectivity, flow, and routing in networks ranging from social groups to computer networks. Recently, network applications have erupted in many fields, and graph models are now being applied in landscape ecology and conservation biology, particularly for applications couched in metapopulation theory. In these applications, graph nodes represent habitat patches or local populations and links indicate functional connections among populations (i.e. via dispersal). Graphs are models of more complicated real systems, and so it is appropriate to review these applications from the perspective of modelling in general. Here we review recent applications of network theory to habitat patches in landscape mosaics. We consider (1) the conceptual model underlying these applications; (2) formalization and implementation of the graph model; (3) model parameterization; (4) model testing, insights, and predictions available through graph analyses; and (5) potential implications for conservation biology and related applications. In general, and for a variety of ecological systems, we find the graph model a remarkably robust framework for applications concerned with habitat connectivity. We close with suggestions for further work on the parameterization and validation of graph models, and point to some promising analytic insights.},

	Abstract = {We use focal-species analysis to apply a graph-theoretic approach to landscape connectivity in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. In doing so we demonstrate the utility of a mathematical graph as an ecological construct with respect to habitat connectivity. Graph theory is a well established mainstay of information technology and is concerned with highly efficient network flow. It employs fast algorithms and compact data structures that are easily adapted to landscape-level focal species analysis. American mink (Mustela vison) and prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea) share the same habitat but have different dispersal capabilities, and therefore provide interesting comparisons on connections in the landscape. We built graphs using GIS coverages to define habitat patches and determined the functional distance between the patches with least-cost path modeling. Using graph operations concerned with edge and node removal we found that the landscape is fundamentally connected for mink and fundamentally unconnected for prothonotary warblers. The advantage of a graph-theoretic approach over other modeling techniques is that it is a heuristic framework which can be applied with very little data and improved from the initial results. We demonstrate the use of graph theory in a metapopulation context, and suggest that graph theory as applied to conservation biology can provide leverage on applications concerned with landscape connectivity.},

@article{urban_landscape_2001,
	Abstract = {Ecologists are familiar with two data structures commonly used to represent landscapes. Vector-based maps delineate land cover types as polygons, while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure, the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (e.g., habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally (e.g., via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields, including geography (transportation networks, routing applications, siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization). We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes, focusing especially on applications of metapopulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct, the minimum spanning tree, can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape connectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida). Simulations with an incidence-function metapopulation model suggest that population persistence can be maintained despite substantial losses of habitat area, so long as the minimum spanning tree is protected. We believe that graph theory has considerable promise for applications concerned with connectivity and ecological flows in general. Because the theory is already well developed in other disciplines, it might be brought to bear immediately on pressing ecological applications in conservation biology and landscape ecology.},

@article{nelson_environmental_2007,
	Abstract = {A combination of favourable temperatures and abundant host trees has resulted in a mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae  Hopkins) epidemic over the majority of the lodgepole pine forests of British Columbia, Canada. Understanding temporal trends in the interactions between mountain pine beetle infestations and landscape characteristics can improve our understanding of beetle biology, inform modelling of future impacts, and support management. In this paper, we demonstrate a practical technique for characterizing spatial interactions between beetles and the environment. The locations with the highest-intensity infestations (hot spots) were identified using point data derived from annual helicopter-based surveys of beetle-infested pine, and a kernel density estimator. By examining the environmental characteristics associated with hot spots through time, an increased understanding of how the mountain pine beetle utilizes resources over large areas is generated. The effect of treatment on the persistence of hot spots is also explored. Results indicate that beetles intensely infest mature trees with a shift to younger trees over time. Hot-spot locations are most commonly associated with stands composed of 30\&ndash;80\% pine and almost always occur at elevations between 800 m and 1000 m. In the early years of an infestation, hot spots are typically found on warmer (south and west) aspects. As well, relative to non-treatment, any type of treatment reduces the persistence of hot spots the following year.},

The contribution of the work is to resolve the following limitations associated with the current land use change modelling paradigm: (1) the source code for model implementations is frequently unavailable, severely compromising the reproducibility of scientific results and making it impossible for members of the community to improve or adapt models for their own purposes; (2) ensemble experiments to capture model structural uncertainty are difficult because of fundamental differences between implementations of alternative models; and (3) additional software is required because existing applications frequently perform only the spatial allocation of change. The package includes a stochastic ordered allocation procedure as well as an implementation of the CLUE-S algorithm. We demonstrate its functionality by simulating land use change at the Plum Island Ecosystems site, using a data set included with the package. It is envisaged that lulcc will enable future model development and comparison within an open environment.},

	Abstract = {The relative operating characteristic (ROC) is a widely-used method to measure diagnostic signals including predictions of land changes, species distributions, and ecological niches. The ROC measures the degree to which presence for a Boolean variable is associated with high ranks of an index. The ROC curve plots the rate of true positives versus the rate of false positives obtained from the comparison between the Boolean variable and multiple diagnoses derived from thresholds applied to the index. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a summary metric, which is commonly reported and frequently criticized. Our manuscript recommends four improvements in the use and interpretation of the ROC curve and its AUC by: (1) highlighting important threshold points on the ROC curve, (2) interpreting the shape of the ROC curve, (3) defining lower and upper bounds for the AUC, and (4) mapping the density of the presence within each bin of the ROC curve. These recommendations encourage scientists to interpret the rich information that the ROC curve can reveal, in a manner that goes far beyond the potentially misleading AUC. We illustrate the benefit of our recommendations by assessing the prediction of land change in a suburban landscape.},

@article{miller_data-driven_2015,
	Abstract = {The context for geographic research has shifted from a data-scarce to a data-rich environment, in which the most fundamental changes are not just the volume of data, but the variety and the velocity at which we can capture georeferenced data; trends often associated with the concept of Big Data. A data-driven geography may be emerging in response to the wealth of georeferenced data flowing from sensors and people in the environment. Although this may seem revolutionary, in fact it may be better described as evolutionary. Some of the issues raised by data-driven geography have in fact been longstanding issues in geographic research, namely, large data volumes, dealing with populations and messy data, and tensions between idiographic versus nomothetic knowledge. The belief that spatial context matters is a major theme in geographic thought and a major motivation behind approaches such as time geography, disaggregate spatial statistics and GIScience. There is potential to use Big Data to inform both geographic knowledge-discovery and spatial modeling. However, there are challenges, such as how to formalize geographic knowledge to clean data and to ignore spurious patterns, and how to build data-driven models that are both true and understandable.},

@article{wang_measuring_2011,
	Abstract = {Natural and anthropogenic disturbances on natural landscapes reduce the abundance and alter the spatial arrangement of certain habitat types. Measuring and modeling such alterations, and their biological effects, remains challenging in part because many widely used configuration metrics are correlated with habitat amount. In this paper, we consider the sources of such correlation, and distinguish process or sample-based correlation from functional correlation that may be an artifact of the metrics themselves. Process correlation is not necessarily a serious problem for statistical inference, but functional correlation would be. We propose that functional correlation may be reduced by normalizing metrics by habitat abundance. We illustrate with normalized versions of total core area, mean nearest neighbor distance, and mean shape index, and show informally that the standard versions of these metrics should exhibit functional correlation. We evaluate the normalized metrics on samples of harvested and undisturbed forested landscapes, and on simulated landscapes generated with varying degrees of spatial autocorrelation. Normalization markedly reduced correlations with habitat abundance on natural landscapes, but not on simulated landscapes. The reasons for this appear to be a combination of differing variances in metric values within levels of habitat abundance, and of the precise form of the relationships between habitat abundance and the un-normalized metrics. In all cases, the normalization changes the ordering of landscapes by metric values across levels of habitat abundance. In consequence, normalized and standard metrics cannot both be accurate measures of configuration. We conclude that statistical modeling of ecological response data is needed to finally determine the merits of the normalizations.},

@article{semecurbe_spatial_2016,
	Abstract = {Case studies in geography are strongly dependent on the size of the spatial units used for the analysis. This has been expressed as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP): whatever the phenomenon under consideration, it is impossible to identify a single spatial partition that would be most appropriate to analyze it. In this respect, multifractal analysis may be an interesting tool for geographers. It integrates not just a series of nested spatial resolutions, as fractal analysis does, but also a series of points of view about the quantity of information contained in each spatial unit. In this article, we first expose the mathematical bases of multifractal analysis and we describe how it applies to geographical analyses. We insist on the mathematical notion of dimension, which allows us to describe how multifractal parameters can be used to quantify the MAUP. Then, we use the method to characterize the spatial distribution of population density in France. The main result is a typology map of population density that uses the MAUP as a descriptive tool. This map allows the joint identification of several phenomena: the main cities, the rural settlement patterns, and several types of periurban settlement patterns.},

@article{sakieh_scenario-based_2015,
	Abstract = {Sustainability analysis of urban complex systems, as an interdisciplinary study, necessitates integrative modeling approaches for analyzing relationships between land parameters and landscape patterns. The present paper emphasizes applicability of dynamic and scenario-based investigation of urban environments for understanding the interactions between urbanization suitability and landscape pattern. Combining parameter modification and model integration approaches for introducing growth alternatives, a basis was established for detailed assessment of the Karaj urban context, Iran. SLEUTH's probabilistic images of future urbanized lands of two growth scenarios (historical trend-based urban growth and compact urban growth) were simultaneously employed as dynamic factors for urbanization suitability mapping and landscape pattern analysis of the years 2011, 2020, 2030 and 2040. Findings of the present studies showed while historical trend-based urban expansion occupied more land resources, this growth option resulted in a more manageable pattern of urban landscape in terms of its connectivity and compactness as well as possessing higher urbanization suitability index across the study time frame. This study addresses utility of scenario-based analysis of urban areas that furnishes urban planners with insights into cumulative impacts of an ongoing urbanization process under different environmental circumstances.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT This article uses statistical results on ratios of quadratic forms to present a closed theory of Moran's I's exact conditional distribution, its moments and feasible range subject to a significant underlying Gaussian spatial process. These results allow one (i) to give by means of the conditional expectation a direct link of an observed value of Moran's I to the autocorrelation level of an underlying spatial process, (ii) to calculate the distribution of local Moran's Ii subject to the forces of a global spatial process which permits the exploration of local heterogeneities within the global process, and (iii) to distinguish between two competing spatial processes. A preliminary regression model to describe the spatial distribution of bladder cancer incidence rates in 219 counties of the former German Democratic Republic is used to demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed exact conditional approach. Furthermore, a theoretical basis to address the migration problem in spatial epidemiology is given and tested against simple spatial clustering.},

	Abstract = {Agent-based complex systems are dynamic networks of many interacting agents; examples include ecosystems, financial markets, and cities. The search for general principles underlying the internal organization of such systems often uses bottom-up simulation models such as cellular automata and agent-based models. No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling. This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity.},

@article{wiegand_dealing_2004,
	Abstract = {It has been argued that spatially explicit population models (SEPMs) cannot provide reliable guidance for conservation biology because of the difficulty of obtaining direct estimates for their demographic and dispersal parameters and because of error propagation. We argue that appropriate model calibration procedures can access additional sources of information, compensating the lack of direct parameter estimates. Our objective is to show how model calibration using population-level data can facilitate the construction of SEPMs that produce reliable predictions for conservation even when direct parameter estimates are inadequate. We constructed a spatially explicit and individual-based population model for the dynamics of brown bears (Ursus arctos) after a reintroduction program in Austria. To calibrate the model we developed a procedure that compared the simulated population dynamics with distinct features of the known population dynamics (=patterns). This procedure detected model parameterizations that did not reproduce the known dynamics. Global sensitivity analysis of the uncalibrated model revealed high uncertainty in most model predictions due to large parameter uncertainties (coefficients of variation CV ≈ 0.8). However, the calibrated model yielded predictions with considerably reduced uncertainty (CV ≈ 0.2). A pattern or a combination of various patterns that embed information on the entire model dynamics can reduce the uncertainty in model predictions, and the application of different patterns with high information content yields the same model predictions. In contrast, a pattern that does not embed information on the entire population dynamics (e.g., bear observations taken from sub-areas of the study area) does not reduce uncertainty in model predictions. Because population-level data for defining (multiple) patterns are often available, our approach could be applied widely.},

@article{van_der_vaart_calibration_2015,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the feasibility of using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to calibrate and evaluate complex individual-based models (IBMs). As ABC evolves, various versions are emerging, but here we only explore the most accessible version, rejection-ABC. Rejection-ABC involves running models a large number of times, with parameters drawn randomly from their prior distributions, and then retaining the simulations closest to the observations. Although well-established in some fields, whether ABC will work with ecological IBMs is still uncertain.

Rejection-ABC was applied to an existing 14-parameter earthworm energy budget IBM for which the available data consist of body mass growth and cocoon production in four experiments. ABC was able to narrow the posterior distributions of seven parameters, estimating credible intervals for each. ABC's accepted values produced slightly better fits than literature values do. The accuracy of the analysis was assessed using cross-validation and coverage, currently the best-available tests. Of the seven unnarrowed parameters, ABC revealed that three were correlated with other parameters, while the remaining four were found to be not estimable given the data available.

It is often desirable to compare models to see whether all component modules are necessary. Here, we used ABC model selection to compare the full model with a simplified version which removed the earthworm's movement and much of the energy budget. We are able to show that inclusion of the energy budget is necessary for a good fit to the data. We show how our methodology can inform future modelling cycles, and briefly discuss how more advanced versions of ABC may be applicable to IBMs. We conclude that ABC has the potential to represent uncertainty in model structure, parameters and predictions, and to embed the often complex process of optimising an IBM's structure and parameters within an established statistical framework, thereby making the process more transparent and objective.},
